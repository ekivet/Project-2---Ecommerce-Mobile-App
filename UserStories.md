They are a connesiour of sorts when it comes to mobile apps and a nicely designed well functioning app will increase the likelyhood that they will do business with any particular company.

User #4

User #4 is new to mobile applications.  Although they like using them, sometimes they find them hard to use or confusing.  This frustrates them, so they prefer using apps that are simple to use and intuitive.  They appreciate a minimalist design that lets them focus their energy on the content being presented rather than having to figure out the user interface.  Less is more to User #4.  An app that takes too much time to figure out usually winds up uninstalled.
